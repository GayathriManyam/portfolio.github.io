    <p style="text-align: center;"><i><h2>Emotional state recognition of a speaker is a difficult task for machine learning algorithms which plays an important 
        role in the field of speech emotion recognition (SER). SER plays a significant role in many real-time applications such
        as human behavior assessment, human-robot interaction, virtual reality, and emergency centers to analyze the emotional
        state of speakers. Previous research in this field is mostly focused on handcrafted features and traditional convolutional 
        neural network (CNN) models used to extract high-level features from speech spectrograms to increase the recognition accuracy 
        and overall model cost complexity. In contrast, we introduce a novel framework for SER using a key sequence segment 
        selection based on redial based function network (RBFN) similarity measurement in clusters. The selected sequence is 
        converted into a spectrogram by applying the STFT algorithm and passed into the CNN model to extract the discriminative and
        salient features from the speech spectrogram. Furthermore, we normalize the CNN features to ensure precise recognition
        performance and feed them to the deep  long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn the temporal information for recognizing
        the final state of emotion. In the proposed technique, we process the key segments instead of the whole utterance to
        reduce the computational complexity of the overall model and normalize the CNN features before their actual processing,
        so that it can easily recognize the Spatio-temporal information.</h2></i></p>
